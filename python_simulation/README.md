# Python BMS Simulation

Short Description:
This module simulates a simplified Battery Management System (BMS).
It generates synthetic sensor data (voltage, temperature, current),
checks safety limits, and visualizes the results using plots.


## How to Run

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run:
python simulate_bms.py

## Skills Demonstrated

- Sensor data simulation
- Safety threshold monitoring
- Basic battery logic
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Engineering-oriented debugging workflow
